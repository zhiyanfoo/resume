# Experience

## Tulip Interfaces 
Boston Greater Area, MA (Sept 2019 - Dec 2019 and May 2020 - August 2020) 

* Reworked deployment to use a distributed build process (via Concourse). Led to 50\% reduction
  in deploy time for microservices (20m to 10m) and enabled multiple parallel builds.
* Built a new Go service that allowed modifications of our customer's Kubernetes ingress. This
  allowed customers to filter traffic to their sites. Permanently stored our
  elasticsearch logs in S3 and partitioned them to be queryable by AWS Athena.
*  Increased on-call alerting coverage via Prometheus and Elasticsearch.  Standardized builds on
   Buildkit, away from default Docker and Rocker.  Experimented with vertical pod autoscaling to
   automate resource allocation on our Kubernetes cluster.

##  Setter
Toronto, CA (Jan 2019 - April 2019)

* Rewrote critical parts of the Node backend in Rust, e.g. real-time quote editor and payment endpoints.
* Helped implement CI/CD (Travis, Docker) for microservices and investigate moving from GCP to AWS.

## Got It 
Hanoi, VN (May 2018 - August 2018)
* Worked on the companies's routing algorithms, the most technically involved part of the companies stack. Extended the system so we could perform real-time matching between professionals for mentoring.

## Quantcast
Singapore (March 2017 - July 2017)
* Cut down the CPU time of a real-time bidding configuration ETL pipeline by 30\%. (Python)
* Used indirection to reduce memory usage and number of sorts needed to shard black/whitelisted domains.
